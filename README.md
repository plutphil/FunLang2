# FunLang2
This is my second attempt at writing an interpreter for a C/JavaScript-like programming language. The fun thing about this language is that it doesn't use operators. Therefore, you don't have to worry about things like operator precedence. 
After reading about PyPy, a very optimized Python interpreter that works stackless, I had to start over. Stackless basically means that your program doesn't use the stack.
